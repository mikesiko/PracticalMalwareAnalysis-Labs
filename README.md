# PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs
Binaries for the book Practical Malware Analysis

## Two download options:
1. Self-extracting archive 
2. 7-zip file with archive password of "malware"

## WARNING
The lab binaries contain malicious code and you should not install or run these programs without first setting up a safe environment.

## Compatibility
The labs are targeted for the Microsoft Windows XP operating system.  Many of the labs work on newer versions of Windows, but some of them will not. Some labs have been rewritten and built for Windows 7, these are included in a seperate archive. The replacement labs have been created to be as close to the original as possible, but following along in the book for answers will not be the same.  The labs are designed to mimic realistic malware.  Some of them are well-written code that runs reliable and some of them (just like real malware) are poorly written code that may crash, contain memory leaks, or otherwise behave unexpectedly.
