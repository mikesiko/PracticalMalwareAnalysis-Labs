# PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs
Binaries for the book Practical Malware Analysis

## Two download options:
1. Self-extracting archive 
2. 7-zip file with archive password of "malware"

## WARNING
The lab binaries contain malicious code and you should not install or run these programs without first setting up a safe environment.

## Compatibility
The labs are targeted for the Microsoft Windows XP operating system.  Many of the labs work on newer versions of Windows, but some of them will not.  The labs are designed to mimic realistic malware.  Some of them are well-written code that runs reliable and some of them (just like real malware) are poorly written code that may crash, contain memory leaks, or otherwise behave unexpectedly.
